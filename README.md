Fibooks is a python library for financial statement analysis. This library supports all 3 main financial statements (balance sheet, income statement and statement of cashflows) and offers a large set of formulas and ratios.
## Getting Started
fibooks can be installed using the *Python package manager*, also known as pip. If you use PyCharm (or any other IDE) then please follow their package installation guidelines. Do note that fibooks was developed using Python 3 so that's the version this package is optimized for regardless of your environment.
``` shell
pip3 install fibooks
```
Once your download is completed you can test whether fibooks has been installed sucessfully. If the following code outputs the current version then you're good to go, if not then please check your installation. If fibooks still refuses to work please let me know through the feedback form down below.
``` python
from fibooks import other

other.info()
```
