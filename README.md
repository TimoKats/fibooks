### Getting Started
---
fibooks can be installed using the *Python package manager*. If you use PyCharm (or any other IDE) then please follow their package installation guidelines. Do note that fibooks was developed using Python 3 so that's the version this package is optimized for.
``` python
pip3 install fibooks
```
If your installation is successfully completed you can test your version of fibooks. If this outputs the version number along with some other info, you're good to go!
